{"name":"Threesixty","tagline":"Simple wrapper for the XBOX 360 controller","body":"# threesixty\r\n\r\nFirst of all, threesixty is based on some parts of [jaraco.input], that's also, why threesixty is released under the MIT license. Nevertheless this library allows you to create XBOX 360 controller based user-interaction without worrying about how to interact with the controller itself. And it's really simple. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nthreesixty is currently Windows-only. You need to have `xinput1_3.dll` installed (which should be included in Windows 7/8 by default). Linux support is planned. \r\n\r\nAfter cloning the repository, you can go ahead and install it via\r\n```sh\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Basic usage\r\nUsing threesixty is indeed quite simple.\r\n```python\r\n>>> import threesixty\r\n>>> controllers = threesixty.controllers()\r\n>>> len(controllers)\r\n1\r\n>>> controller = controllers[0]\r\n>>> state = controller.get()\r\n>>> state[threesixty.BATTERY_LEVEL] == threesixty.BATTERY_LEVEL_MEDIUM\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `examples` directory of the repository contains some simple examples which should explain, how threesixty works. \r\n\r\n## What threesixty isn't\r\n- A game engine\r\n\t- threesixty was meant to be used for any application, but not in order to replace a real game engine. It allows you to use a controller, but that's it\r\n\r\n- A perfect event handling system\r\n\t- It handles events, but doesn't use any library like [zope.event]. threesixty uses a multithreaded callback system to fire its events. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[jaraco.input]:http://pydoc.net/Python/jaraco.input/1.0.1/jaraco.input.win32.xinput/\r\n[zope.event]:https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.event","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
